    \item Prisoners A, B, and C are in jail and the jailer tells them that one will be executed and the other two set free.

Show that the probability of choosing a human at random and picking the Pope is not the same as the probability of the Pope being human. In the animated series Futurama, the (Space) Pope is a reptile. How does this change your previous calculations? \\

\noindent Let's assume there are $7.8\cdot 10^{8}$ (780,000,000) humans and there is only 1 Pope. If a human is picked at random from the entire human population, the chances of that person being the pope is 1 in $7.8\cdot 10^{8}$.
$$ p\left(\text{Pope}|human\right) = \frac{1}{7.8\cdot 10^{8}} $$
Moreover, given the Pope, there is a 100 percent chance that he or she is human
$$ p\left(\text{human}|\text{Pope}\right) = 1 $$
Now consider the Futurama case in which the (space) Pope is a reptile. We then have
$$ p\left(\text{Pope}|\text{human}\right) = 0 $$
$$ p\left(\text{human}|\text{Pope}\right) = 0 $$

\textbf{Extending Regression Modeling: Jupyter Notebook Examples} \\
The notebook provides examples of the following four extensions to the basic Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) formulation
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variable Transformation
    \begin{itemize} \item response: baby length; predictor: baby age in months \end{itemize}
    \item Varying Uncertainty
        \begin{itemize}
            \item same data, but allows response variance to be heteroskedastic
        \end{itemize}
    \item Interaction Effects
        \begin{itemize}
            \item comparing additive and multiplicative (i.e. interaction) models using restaurant bill data
        \end{itemize}
    \item Robust Regression
        \begin{itemize}
            \item utilize $t$-distribution to make regression model more resistant to influence by extreme outlier values
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{MODULE THREE (4)} Bayesian Regression - Hierarchical Models


$\newline$
\textbf{Hierarchical Prior Example - Therapeutic Touch (TT)} \\
Jupyter Notebook about the following study:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Health care practitioners sweep their hands over a patientâ€™s body at a distance of 5-10 cm and sense whether and where the patient has depleted energy.
    \item If depletion is found, the practitioners then attempt to 'repattern' the patient's energy field.
    \item 28 practitioners participated in a sutdy of this technique.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TT practicitioner holds out both hands, palm up, with a view of her hand blocked by a screen.
        \item Tester randomly puts his/her right hand over one of the practitioner's hands.
        \ Practitioner must say which hand was near the tester's hand.
        \item Each TT practitioner has 10 trials.
        \item If we randomly guessed the hand, we would expect 5 to be correct because each of the two outcomes has a .50 probability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Donnie Brown provides some modeling suggestions:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $\omega$ be the mean number of correct guesses by a practitioner.
    \item Assume a flat (i.e. uninformative) prior for the group mean
        $$ \omega \sim \text{beta}\left(1,1\right) $$
    \item $\kappa$ denotes the extent to which each practitioner's ability to correctly identify the hand is dependent upon the group mean.
    \item Assume the mean of $\kappa$ is 10.
    \item Assume the standard deviation of $\kappa$ is 10.
    \item Apply sampling to get an estimate for $\theta_{j}, j = 1, \ldots, 28 $ (i.e. an estimate for each of the 28 practitioners).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \item Minnesota EPA data supplied for 80 thousand houses.
    \item Predictor variables
